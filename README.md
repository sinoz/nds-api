# NDS API
A simple to use framework that allows users to extract or make raw use of resources such as images from NDS ROMs. The following file system formats are supported:
  - [ ] NARC (Nitro Archive)
  - [ ] BTX0 (Basic Texture)
  - [ ] NCGR (Nitro Graphic Resource)
  - [ ] NCLR (Nitro Colour Resource)

The framework makes use of the following dependencies:
  * Netty rev4.1.0
  * Guava rev19
  
The project is compiled to and thus requires at least Java 7.
